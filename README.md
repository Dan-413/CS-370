Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science
In this project, I worked on a maze navigation problem using deep Q-learning. I was given Python code that implemented a maze environment, an intelligent agent using Q-learning, and a neural network for approximating Q-values. My tasks included modifying and implementing parts of the Q-learning algorithm, training the agent with experience replay and a neural network, and conducting experiments to enhance its learning and performance.

Connecting this project to the broader field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
As a computer scientist, my role involves analyzing problems, designing algorithms, and developing software solutions to address diverse challenges. In this project, I applied computer science principles to create an intelligent agent capable of learning and navigating a maze. The work contributes to the broader field by showcasing how computational approaches can solve complex problems and automate decision-making.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves a systematic methodology. I broke down the maze navigation challenge into manageable components, designed algorithms, and iteratively refined the solution. This structured approach is integral to problem-solving in computer science and ensures effective solutions to complex issues.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I recognize ethical responsibilities to ensure fairness, transparency, and security in solutions. In the context of developing intelligent agents, considerations such as avoiding biases, ensuring transparency in decision-making, and protecting user data become crucial. Upholding ethical standards is essential for responsible development and deployment of computational solutions.

Overall, my work on this project aligns with the principles and practices of computer science, where the application of innovative technologies and ethical considerations are paramount.
